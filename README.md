Craftable Axes

The mod is based on ["Craftable Axes"](http://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php/topic/2008-craftable-axes/) by Tooks and ["Broad Hatchet for Fire Axe"](http://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php/topic/13233-broad-hatchet-for-fire-axe/) by  Aardman55.

## Borrowed fashion features
* 3 Types of Axe Heads
* Craftable Axe Handles
* A Makeshift Axe (degrades slightly faster than the Fireaxe)
* A Worn Makeshift Axe (Degrades faster than the fireaxe and deals slightly less damage}
* A Blunt Makeshift Axe (Considered a blunt weapon, no longer using the Blade skill. Deals less damage and degrades faster than a Fireaxe) 

## Distinction
* Add sprites for Axe Handle and Axe Heads.
* To create the handle is needed now also knife apart saws. In order to cut the right hand. The speed depends on the type of blade. Hunting knife does not break down and fit always.
* Craft Axe Head from Worn Axe Head, using leather belt and stone. It takes a long time.
* Craft Worn Axe Head from Blunt Axe Head, using stone. It takes a long time.
* Russian translate.
